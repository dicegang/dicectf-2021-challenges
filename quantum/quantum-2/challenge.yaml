  Let's increase the difficulty. Same algorithm, new circuit.

  In practice, quantum compilers and programmers make use of techniques which don't exist in classical reversible computing, even for seemingly classical subroutines. While this circuit has more gates than the `quantum 1` circuit, it also requires much fewer qubits. In fact, the main computational step only uses [2n+3 qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205095).
