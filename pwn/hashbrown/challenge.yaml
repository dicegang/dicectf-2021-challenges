  Who doesn't like hashbrowns? I like them so much that I wrote a driver named after them! But apparently programming is hard and I might have made a mistake...

  Please note that the following measures are active (whether they are important to the exploit process is up to you):
  ```
  CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_RANDOM=y
  CONFIG_SLAB=y
  CONFIG_FG_KASLR=y
  ```
  SMAP, SMEP, and KPTI are enabled as well.

  `{{nc}}`

  Note: only one connection per IP is allowed, and there is a 10 minute wall-clock time limit from the moment you connect. Test locally!

provide:
  - ./bzImage
  - ./run.sh
  - ./distributed/initramfs.cpio
  - ./distributed/hashbrown_distributed.c
